Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Here in this project I have designed a webpage to help those grow in their understanding of Jesus.
In the index.html contains the links that will lead to the other pages which contain the information.
It also has a container that holds the links. There both stylsheets are linked to it as well as a navbar.

In the table.html, like its name, contains a table which will adjust based on the size of the webpage.
As well as a unordered list which a user can use to navigate to other pages. The navbar can be found here as well. A different link is here that will lead to a different webpage all together.

In questions.html there is another unordered list that is clickable which will jump to the question that is represented in the list. And as the other pages also has the navbar. The navbar when clicked will lead one back to the homepage.

I decided to take a different approach in error.html which is were I used the inheritance scss. However it still provides options to reroute to the other pages. This is the only page that did not have the navbar.

Every single html page is using an image for the background. The media query is applied to the table html.
Thank you.
