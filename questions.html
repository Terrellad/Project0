        <h3 class="questions" id="Why do we die?">Why do we die?</h3>
        <p>Sin entered the world and God did not want us to live forever in sin so God took away the tree of life from the garden of Eden (Genesis 3:22-24, 1 Corinthians 15:56) So it is because of sin that we die. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="questions" id="Why does God allow evil to exist?">Why does God allow evil to exist?</h3>
        <p>All root of evil is the result of sin. (Isaiah 59:4) So in order for God to remove all evil he would have to remove all things tainted by sin. (Ephesians 2:1-3) Which would include <a>all</a> of us, mankind. Those who are good and bad. (Matthew 15:19)
          But because of his great love for us is why he is allowing evil to exist... for now. (John 3:16, Romans 5:5, 1 John 4:7,16)
        </p>
        <h3 class="questions" id="What is the point of life?">What is the point of life?</h3>
        <p>To have a relationship with God. He used to walk in the cool of the day with Adam and Eve until the fall (Genesis 3:8)
          After which because of his love for them gave them skins of animals to cover themselves. (Genesis 3:21) God's love did not stop there,
          throughout the centeries God has been looking after man seeking relationship. That is why Jesus came, died, and rose again to restore that relationship! (John 3:16)
        </p>
        <h3 class="questions" id="Why do I exist?">Why do I exist?</h3>
        <p>Because God wanted you to exist and is very pleased of how he created you. He loves you so much that he has created you in his image! God also has a plan for your life Psalm 139:14 "I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are your works and that my soul knows very well.".
           Genesis 1:26-27 (God made man in his image). Romans 8:29 "For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son...". Jeremiah 1:5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you...".
         </p>
        <h3 class="questions" id="Who is Jesus?">Who is Jesus?</h3>
        <p>He is the Son of God (Hebrews 4:14) The third person of the trinity of God (Galatians 4:4, 1 Corinthians 12:3-6, John 1:32-33) Known also as the Word of God (John 1:1-17) Came to the earth to give his life a ransom for many. Meaning he would willing sacrifice his life for the sins of the world! (Matthew 20:28, 1 John 2:2, Galatians 1:4)
          And rose again from the dead on the third day. (Luke 24:7, Luke 18:33, Matthew 28:7) He now sits at the right hand of God. (Colossians 3:1) For more information about what Jesus completed go to the <a href="Jesus">prophecies</a> page.

        <h3 class="questions" id="What will happen in the future?">What will happen in the future?</h3>
        <p>God throughout the Bible spoke of the end of the time and the judgement to come. Daniel chapter 9 through 11, 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, Isaiah chapter 24, Matthew chapter 24, Luke chapter 21, 2 Peter chapter 2, Revelation chapter 4 through the end of the book.
          Once the Church, which are believers in Jesus Christ, will be raptured (1 Thessalonians 4:13-17, Revelation 4:1, 1 Corinthians 15:50-54) then God will pour out judgement in three different series. The seven Seals, the seven Trumpets, then the seven Bowl judgements. (Revelation 6-20)
          These will bring war, famine, diseases, death, water around the world turning to blood, the sun used to scorch the earth, and the rise and fall of the Antichrist.

        <p>To understand one can remember the name MAPS. M being the manuscript evidence, A the archaeological evidence, P being prophetic prophecy, and S being the statistical evidence.
          First the manuscript evidence there exist today around 28,000 manuscripts of the New Testament from the first centery that validates the Bible we have today is accurate. Second the archaeological evidence. In the area known as the Bible lands, which is the middle east,
          archaeologist have used the Bible and have found places where written in stone was the name of Pontus Pilate which is now in the museum of Jerusalem. In an orchard field there was ruins which had the name of King David etched in the wall. Cities have been found such as the city of Magdala where Mary of Magdalene was from.
          Third is the prophetic prophecy which are very percise. The Bible named kings that would come into power hundreds of years before they came on the scene. (Isaiah 44:28, 2 Chronicles 36:22-23, Ezra 1:1-2) Last the statistical evidence. In the book "Science Speaks" written by Peter W. Stoner he calculated the probablity of
          one person fulfilling <a>eight</a> prophecies was one in ten to the seveteenth power. To fully grasp the depth of this Stoner gives an illustration. He said suppose you take ten to the seventeenth power silver half-dollars and laid them out you could cover the state of Texas two feet deep.
           Then you take one of the silver half-dollars and paint it red and toss it into the mass of half-dollars and stir the mass throughly. Then blindfold a man and drop him in Dallas and tell him he can travel as far as he wants but can only pickup one coin. The odds of him of picking up the one red coin would be the same odds for one person
           to complete just <a>eight</a> of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled. Jesus fulfilled roughly <a>three hundred</a> prophecies!
