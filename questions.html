        <p>To have a relationship with God. He used to walk in the cool of the day with Adam and Eve until the fall (Genesis 3:8)
          After which because of his love for them gave them skins of animals to cover themselves. (Genesis 3:21) God's love did not stop there,
          throughout the centeries God has been looking after man seeking relationship. That is why Jesus came, died, and rose again to restore that relationship! (John 3:16)
        </p>
        <h3 class="questions" id="Why do I exist?">Why do I exist?</h3>
        <p>Because God wanted you to exist and is very pleased of how he created you. He loves you so much that he has created you in his image!
